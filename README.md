# What is Wordle?
Wordle is a word game with the object of guessing the mystery five-letter word in as few guesses as possible.

You will have six chances to guess the mystery word.

To kick off the game, you must enter a valid five-letter word. Hit the enter/return button to submit.

After each guess, the color of the letter will change to show how close your guess was to the mystery word:
* If the letter turns green, it means that letter is in the mystery word and you have placed it in the right spot.
* If the letter turns yellow, it means that letter is in the mystery word but you have it in the wrong position.
* If the letter turns gray, it means that letter is not in the mystery word at all.
