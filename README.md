# What is Wordle?

Wordle is a word game owned and published by The New York Times. The object of the game is to guess the mystery five-letter word in as few guesses as possible.

You will have six chances to guess the mystery word.

To kick off the game, you must enter a valid five-letter word. Hit the enter/return button to submit.

After each guess, the color of the letter will change to show how close your guess was to the mystery word:
* If the letter turns green, it means that letter is in the correct spot in the mystery word.
* If the letter turns yellow, it means that letter is in the mystery word but is currently in the wrong position.
* If the letter turns gray, it means that letter is not in the mystery word at all.
